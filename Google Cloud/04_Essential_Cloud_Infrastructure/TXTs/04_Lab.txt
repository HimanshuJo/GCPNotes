VM instances without external IP addresses are isolated from external networks. 

Using Cloud NAT, these instances can access the internet for updates and patches, and in some cases, for bootstrapping. 

As a managed service, Cloud NAT provides high availability without user management and intervention.

-------

Cloud NAT logging allows you to log NAT connections and errors. 

	When Cloud NAT logging is enabled, one log entry can be generated for each of the following scenarios:

		When a network connection using NAT is created.

		When a packet is dropped because no port was available for NAT.
		
		You can opt to log both kinds of events, or just one or the other. Created logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
