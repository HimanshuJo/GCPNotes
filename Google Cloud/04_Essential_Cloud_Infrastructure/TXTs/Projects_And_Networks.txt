Projects 

	are the key organizer of infrastructure resources in Google Cloud.

	associates objects and services with billing.

-------

There are different types of networks: default, auto, and custom.

	Default:

		Every project is provided with a default VPC network with preset subnets and firewall rules.

		Specifically, a subnet is allocated for each region with non-overlapping CIDR blocks and firewall rules that allow ingress traffic for ICMP, RDP, and SSH traffic from anywhere, as well as ingress traffic from within the default network for all protocols and ports.

	-------

	Auto:

		In an auto mode network, one subnet from each region is automatically created within it.

		The default network is actually an auto mode network.

		These automatically created subnets use a set of predefined IP ranges with a /20 mask that can be expanded to /16.

		Therefore, as new Google Cloud regions become available, new subnets in those regions are automatically added to auto mode networks using an IP range from that block.

		All of these subnets fit within the 10.128.0.0/9 CIDR block.
