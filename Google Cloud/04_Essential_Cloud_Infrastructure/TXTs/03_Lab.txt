VPC:

	Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides networking functionality to Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances, Kubernetes Engine containers, and the App Engine flexible environment. 

	In other words, without a VPC network, you cannot create VM instances, containers, or App Engine applications.

	Therefore, each Google Cloud project has a default network to get you started.

	-------

	You can think of a VPC network as similar to a physical network, except that it is virtualized within Google Cloud. A VPC network is a global resource that consists of a list of regional virtual subnetworks (subnets) in data centers, all connected by a global wide area network (WAN). VPC networks are logically isolated from each other in Google Cloud.

	-------

	Default Network:

		The default network with its subnets.
	
		Each subnet is associated with a Google Cloud region and a private RFC 1918 CIDR block for its internal IP addresses range and a gateway.

-------

Routes:

	Routes tell VM instances and the VPC network how to send traffic from an instance to a destination, either inside the network or outside Google Cloud. 

	Each VPC network comes with some default routes to route traffic among its subnets and send traffic from eligible instances to the internet.

-------

Firewall:

	Each VPC network implements a distributed virtual firewall that you can configure. 

	Firewall rules allow you to control which packets are allowed to travel to which destinations. 

	Every VPC network has two implied firewall rules that block all incoming connections and allow all outgoing connections.

To create the privatenet-us-vm instance:

	gcloud compute instances create privatenet-us-vm 
												 --zone=Lab Zone 
												 --machine-type=e2-micro 
												 --subnet=privatesubnet-us 
												 --image-family=debian-11 
												 --image-project=debian-cloud 
												 --boot-disk-size=10GB 
												 --boot-disk-type=pd-standard 
												 --boot-disk-device-name=pri

To test connectivity to mynet-eu-vm's external IP

	ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's external IP here>

	ping -c 3 <Enter managementnet-us-vm's external IP here>

-------

To test connectivity to privatenet-us-vm's external IP

	ping -c 3 <Enter privatenet-us-vm's external IP here>

-------

To test connectivity to mynet-eu-vm's internal IP

	ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's internal IP here>

-------

To test connectivity to managementnet-us-vm's internal IP

	ping -c 3 <Enter managementnet-us-vm's internal IP here>

us-central1 -> 10.128.0.0/20

europe-west1 -> 10.132.0.0/20

-------

10.128.0.2 104.154.87.11

10.132.0.2 34.77.100.53

10.128.0.2 34.69.248.222

-------

So even though this Instance is in the same zone as these other instances I'm trying to ping, the fact that they are in a different network does not allow me to ping on the internal IP, unless we set up other mechanisms such as VPC peering or a VPN.
