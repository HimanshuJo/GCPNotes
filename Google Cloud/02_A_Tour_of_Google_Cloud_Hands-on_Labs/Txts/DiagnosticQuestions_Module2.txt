1. Cymbal Superstore has a need to populate visual dashboards with historical time-based data. This is an analytical 	use-case. Which two storage solutions could they use?

	Big Query

	Cloud Bigtable

-------

2. The projected amount of cloud storage required for Cymbal Superstore to enable users to post pictures for project 	reviews is 10 TB of immediate access storage in the US and 30 TB of storage for historical posts in a bucket 	 	 located near Cymbal Superstore’s headquarters. The contents of this bucket will need to be accessed once every 30 	  days. You want to estimate the cost of these storage resources to ensure this is economically feasible. What 			should you do?

	Use the pricing calculator to estimate the price for 10 TB of multi-region Standard storage, 30 TB for regional Nearline, and egress charges for reads from the bucket.

3. Cymbal Superstore is piloting an update to its ecommerce app for the flagship store in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The app is implemented as a three-tier web service with traffic originating from the local area and resources dedicated for it in us-central1. You need to configure a secure, low-cost network load-balancing architecture for it. How do you proceed?

	Configure a standard tier proxied external https load balancer connected to the web tier as a frontend and a regional internal load balancer between the web tier and the backend.

-------

4. Cymbal Superstore decides to migrate their supply chain application to Google Cloud. You need to configure specific operating system dependencies. What should you do?

	Implement an application using virtual machines on Compute Engine.
	
-------

5. Cymbal Superstore needs to analyze whether they met quarterly sales projections. Analysts assigned to run this query are familiar with SQL. What data solution should they implement?
	
	BigQuery

-------

6. Cymbal Superstore’s supply chain application frequently analyzes large amounts of data to inform business processes and operational dashboards. What storage class would make sense for this use case?

	Standard 

	Standard storage is best for data that is frequently accessed ("hot" data) and/or stored for only brief periods of time. In addition, co-locating your resources by selecting the regional option maximizes the performance for data-intensive computations and can reduce network charges.

-------

7. An application running on a highly-customized version of Ubuntu needs to be migrated to Google Cloud. You need to do this in the least amount of time with minimal code changes. How should you proceed?
	
	Implement a Kubernetes cluster and create pods to enable your app.

-------

8. Cymbal Superstore decides to pilot a cloud application for their point of sale system in their flagship store. You want to focus on code and develop your solution quickly, and you want your code to be portable. How do you proceed?

	Package your code to a container image and post it to Cloud Run.
	
-------

9. You want to deploy a microservices application. You need full control of how you manage containers, reliability, and autoscaling, but don’t want or need to manage the control plane. Which compute option should you use?

	Google Kubernetes Engine

-------

10. Which Google Cloud load balancing option runs at Layer 7 of the TCP stack?

	Global http(s)

13. Cymbal Superstore has a need to populate visual dashboards with historical time-based data. This is an analytical use-case. Which two storage solutions could they use?

	Cloud Bigtable
	(Cloud Bigtable is a petabyte scale, NoSQL, column family database with row keys optimized for specific queries. It is used to store historic, time-based data and answers the need for this requirement)

	BigQuery
	(BigQuery is a data warehouse offering optimized to query historical time-based data. BigQuery can run queries against data in its own column-based store or run federated queries against data from other data services and file stores)
