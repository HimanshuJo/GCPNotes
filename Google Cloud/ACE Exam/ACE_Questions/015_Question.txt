You have designed a solution on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that uses multiple GCP products. Your company has asked you to estimate the costs of the solution. You need to provide estimates for the monthly total cost. What should you do?
	
	A. For each GCP product in the solution, review the pricing details on the products pricing page. Use the pricing calculator to total the monthly costs for each GCP product. [✔️]
	
	B. For each GCP product in the solution, review the pricing details on the products pricing page. Create a Google Sheet that summarizes the expected monthly costs for each product. [chatGPT suggested]
	
	C. Provision the solution on GCP. Leave the solution provisioned for 1 week. Navigate to the Billing Report page in the Google Cloud Platform Console. Multiply the 1 week cost to determine the monthly costs. [Suggested]
	
	D. Provision the solution on GCP. Leave the solution provisioned for 1 week. Use Stackdriver to determine the provisioned and used resource amounts. Multiply the 1 week cost to determine the monthly costs.

Bard:

	The most appropriate approach to estimate the costs of a GCP solution that uses multiple GCP products is A. For each GCP product in the solution, review the pricing details on the products pricing page. Use the pricing calculator to total the monthly costs for each GCP product.

	This approach offers several advantages:

		Accuracy: 

			Estimating costs based on pricing details and the pricing calculator provides a reliable and accurate assessment of monthly costs.

		Granularity: 

			Evaluating each GCP product individually ensures that all potential costs are considered and accounted for.

		Scalability: 

			This approach can be easily adapted to different pricing models and usage scenarios.

		Cost-Effectiveness: 

			Estimating costs before provisioning resources helps avoid unexpected expenses.

	The other options are less suitable for this task:

		Option B: Creating a Google Sheet summarizing expected costs is a manual process that may not capture all potential costs or accurately reflect real-world usage patterns.

		Option C: Provisioning the solution and waiting for a week to generate billing data is time-consuming and may not provide accurate estimates for fluctuating costs.

		Option D: Using Stackdriver to determine provisioned and used resource amounts is not sufficient for estimating costs without considering pricing details and usage patterns.

	Therefore, option A, which involves using the pricing calculator to estimate monthly costs based on product pricing details, is the most efficient and accurate method for this scenario.
