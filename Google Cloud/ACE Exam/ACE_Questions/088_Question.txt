You need to set a budget alert for use of Compute Engineer services on one of the three Google Cloud Platform projects that you manage. All three projects are linked to a single billing account. What should you do? [Question 88]
	
	A. Verify that you are the project billing administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget and alert for the appropriate project. [✔️]
	
	B. Verify that you are the project billing administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget and a custom alert. [Suggested and chatGPT Suggested]
	
	C. Verify that you are the project administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget for the appropriate project.
	
	D. Verify that you are project administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget and a custom alert.

C. Verify that you are the project administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget for the appropriate project.

	Not recommended: Project administrators may not have the necessary permissions to set billing-related budgets and alerts; it's typically a responsibility of the project billing administrator.

D. Verify that you are the project administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget and a custom alert.

	Not recommended: Similar to option C, project administrators may not have the necessary permissions for setting billing-related budgets and alerts.

	The most appropriate approach for creating a budget alert for Compute Engine services on one of three projects in a single billing account is A. Verify that you are the project billing administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget and alert for the appropriate project.

		Setting a budget alert requires the necessary permissions to manage billing for the specific project. Verifying that you are the project billing administrator ensures that you have the authority to create and configure budgets for the project.

		After verifying your permissions, you can select the associated billing account and create a budget specifically for the project where you want to monitor Compute Engine usage. This ensures that the budget and alert are applied only to the intended project.

	The other options are not as appropriate for this task:

		B. Verify that you are the project billing administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget and a custom alert.

			Creating a custom alert requires additional configuration beyond setting a simple budget alert.

		C. Verify that you are the project administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget for the appropriate project.

			While being a project administrator grants you access to certain billing-related tasks, it may not be sufficient for creating a budget alert.

		D. Verify that you are project administrator. Select the associated billing account and create a budget and a custom alert.

			This option is similar to B, but it also includes creating a custom alert, which may not be necessary for this specific task.

	Therefore, option A, which involves verifying billing permissions, selecting the appropriate billing account, and creating a budget alert specifically for the target project, is the most straightforward and accurate approach to achieve the desired outcome.
