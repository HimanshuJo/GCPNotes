You need a dynamic way of provisioning VMs on Compute Engine. The exact specifications will be in a dedicated configuration file. You want to follow Google's recommended practices. Which method should you use?
	
	A. Deployment Manager [✔️]
	
	B. Cloud Composer
	
	C. Managed Instance Group
	
	D. Unmanaged Instance Group

Bard:

	The correct answer is A. Deployment Manager.

		Deployment Manager is the recommended tool for provisioning VMs on Compute Engine dynamically. It allows you to define the desired state of your infrastructure in a declarative configuration file, and it will take care of provisioning and managing the VMs for you. This is a more efficient and reliable approach than using other methods, such as Cloud Composer or unmanaged instance groups.

	The other options are not suitable for dynamic provisioning of VMs:

		Option B, Cloud Composer, is a workflow orchestration platform that can be used to provision VMs, but it is not as efficient or reliable as Deployment Manager.

		Option C, Managed Instance Group, is a managed service for managing groups of VMs, but it is not designed for dynamic provisioning.

		Option D, Unmanaged Instance Group, is a manual way of provisioning VMs, and it is not suitable for dynamic provisioning.

	Therefore, Deployment Manager is the most appropriate tool for dynamically provisioning VMs on Compute Engine. It provides a declarative and efficient way to manage your infrastructure, and it aligns with Google's recommended practices.
