Your company runs one batch process in an on-premises server that takes around 30 hours to complete. The task runs monthly, can be performed offline, and must be restarted if interrupted. You want to migrate this workload to the cloud while minimizing cost. What should you do?

Given the scenario where the batch process takes around 30 hours, runs monthly, can be performed offline, and must be restarted if interrupted, let's evaluate each option:

A. Migrate the workload to a Compute Engine Preemptible VM.

	Preemptible VMs are cost-effective but come with the limitation that they can be terminated by Google Cloud with very little notice (up to 30 seconds). If the batch process can be restarted from the beginning if interrupted and the potential loss of a Preemptible VM is acceptable, this could be a cost-effective option.

B. Migrate the workload to a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster with Preemptible nodes.

	Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Preemptible nodes is similar to option A but provides additional flexibility and scalability. However, it adds complexity compared to using individual Compute Engine instances.

C. Migrate the workload to a Compute Engine VM. Start and stop the instance as needed.

	This option allows you to manually start and stop the instance. While this provides flexibility, it might not be the most efficient or automated solution for a monthly batch process that can run for an extended period.

D. Create an Instance Template with Preemptible VMs On. Create a Managed Instance Group from the template and adjust 		Target CPU Utilization. Migrate the workload.

	This option combines the benefits of Preemptible VMs with the scalability and automation of a Managed Instance Group. Adjusting Target CPU Utilization allows you to automatically adjust the number of instances based on the workload, providing a good balance of cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion:
	
	Option D, "Create an Instance Template with Preemptible VMs On. Create a Managed Instance Group from the template and adjust Target CPU Utilization. Migrate the workload," seems to be a well-balanced solution. It leverages the cost advantages of Preemptible VMs, provides automation through a Managed Instance Group, and allows for scaling based on the workload. This can help minimize costs while efficiently handling the monthly batch process.

Bard:

	The correct answer is A. Migrate the workload to a Compute Engine Preemptible VM.

		This is the most cost-effective option for migrating the batch process to the cloud as Preemptible VMs offer up to 90% lower compute costs. Since the batch process runs monthly and can be performed offline, the potential for preemptions is minimal, further reducing costs.

	Option B, migrating to a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with Preemptible nodes, would involve additional complexity and management overhead. While GKE offers flexibility and scalability, it might not be necessary for a single batch process.

	Option C, migrating to a Compute Engine VM and starting and stopping the instance as needed, would not be as cost-effective as using Preemptible VMs. Since the process runs monthly, there would be significant downtime associated with stopping and starting the instance each time.

	Option D, creating an Instance Template with Preemptible VMs On, creating a Managed Instance Group from the template, and adjusting Target CPU Utilization, is an alternative approach that could optimize costs. However, it involves more setup and maintenance compared to directly using Preemptible VMs.

	Therefore, migrating the workload directly to a Compute Engine Preemptible VM is the most cost-effective and straightforward solution for running the monthly batch process. The availability of Preemptible VMs allows Google Cloud to offer significant savings without compromising the process's ability to run offline and be restarted if interrupted.
