You need to configure IAM access audit logging in BigQuery for external auditors. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. What should you do?
	
	A. Add the auditors group to the 'logging.viewer' and 'bigQuery.dataViewer' predefined IAM roles. [✔️]
	
	B. Add the auditors group to two new custom IAM roles.
	
	C. Add the auditor user accounts to the 'logging.viewer' and 'bigQuery.dataViewer' predefined IAM roles.
	
	D. Add the auditor user accounts to two new custom IAM roles. [Bard Suggested] [✔️]

-------

A. Add the auditors group to the 'logging.viewer' and 'bigQuery.dataViewer' predefined IAM roles.

	Recommended: This option is aligned with Google-recommended practices. By adding the auditors group to the 'logging.viewer' role, members will have access to view logs, and by adding them to the 'bigQuery.dataViewer' role, they will have read access to BigQuery datasets, enabling them to audit access.

B. Add the auditors group to two new custom IAM roles.

	Not necessary: While creating custom roles is an option, using predefined roles like 'logging.viewer' and 'bigQuery.dataViewer' is generally more straightforward and aligns with best practices.

C. Add the auditor user accounts to the 'logging.viewer' and 'bigQuery.dataViewer' predefined IAM roles.

	Valid but less scalable: If you have a small number of auditors and prefer individual assignments, this could work, but using a group (Option A) is more scalable and easier to manage.

D. Add the auditor user accounts to two new custom IAM roles.

	Not necessary: Using predefined roles is recommended, and creating custom roles might introduce unnecessary complexity.

In summary, option A, adding the auditors group to the 'logging.viewer' and 'bigQuery.dataViewer' predefined roles, is the most straightforward and aligns with Google-recommended practices.

Bard:

	The most appropriate approach to configure IAM access audit logging in BigQuery for external auditors is D. Add the auditor user accounts to two new custom IAM roles.

	This approach offers several advantages:

		Granular Access Control: 

			Creating custom IAM roles allows for fine-grained control over the access granted to the auditors, enabling them to only view specific audit logs related to BigQuery activity.

		Audit Trail Visibility: 

			By granting the roles 'logging.viewer' and 'bigQuery.dataViewer', the auditors can effectively track access to BigQuery resources and identify any unauthorized or suspicious activity.

		Security and Compliance: 

			Creating custom IAM roles and granting them only the necessary permissions aligns with Google's recommended practices for security and compliance purposes.

	The other options are less suitable for this task:

		Option A: Adding the auditors group to the predefined IAM roles 'logging.viewer' and 'bigQuery.dataViewer' grants them broader access to audit logs and BigQuery data, which may not be appropriate for external auditors.

		Option B: Adding the auditors group to two new custom IAM roles is not as secure as adding individual user accounts, as it could allow unauthorized access if the group membership is compromised.

		Option C: Adding the auditor user accounts directly to the predefined IAM roles 'logging.viewer' and 'bigQuery.dataViewer' grants them excessive access to audit logs and BigQuery data, which is not recommended for external auditors.

	Therefore, option D, which involves creating custom IAM roles for individual auditor user accounts and granting them only the necessary permissions, is the most secure, compliant, and appropriate approach for this scenario.
