You want to deploy an application on Cloud Run that processes messages from a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. What should you do? [Question 64]
	
	A. 1. Create a Cloud Function that uses a Cloud Pub/Sub trigger on that topic. 2. Call your application on Cloud Run from the Cloud Function for every message.
	
	B. 1. Grant the Pub/Sub Subscriber role to the service account used by Cloud Run. 2. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription for that topic. 3. Make your application pull messages from that subscription. [chatGPT Suggested]
	
	C. 1. Create a service account. 2. Give the Cloud Run Invoker role to that service account for your Cloud Run application. 3. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription that uses that service account and uses your Cloud Run application as the push endpoint. [✔️]
	
	D. 1. Deploy your application on Cloud Run on GKE with the connectivity set to Internal. 2. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription for that topic. 3. In the same Google Kubernetes Engine cluster as your application, deploy a container that takes the messages and sends them to your application. [Suggested]

Bard:

	The most appropriate and Google-recommended approach for deploying an application on Cloud Run that processes messages from a Cloud Pub/Sub topic is C. Create a service account. 2. Give the Cloud Run Invoker role to that service account for your Cloud Run application. 3. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription that uses that service account and uses your Cloud Run application as the push endpoint.

	This approach offers several advantages:

		Efficient Processing: 

			The Cloud Pub/Sub service will push messages directly to your Cloud Run application using a dedicated service account, eliminating the need for your application to actively pull messages from the subscription. This improves efficiency and reduces the load on your application.

		Reduced Operational Overhead: 

			This approach simplifies deployment and management, as you don't need to maintain a separate script or service to invoke your Cloud Run application for each message.

		Granular Access Control: 

			By granting the Cloud Run Invoker role to the service account, you ensure that only authorized messages can trigger your Cloud Run application, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.

	The other options have limitations:

		Option A: Using a Cloud Function to trigger your Cloud Run application for each message introduces additional overhead and latency compared to the direct push approach.

		Option B: Granting the Pub/Sub Subscriber role to the Cloud Run service account requires your application to pull messages from the subscription, which can increase load and complexity.

		Option D: Deploying your application on Cloud Run on GKE with internal connectivity limits the scalability and flexibility of your deployment. It also requires managing an additional container for message forwarding.

	Therefore, option C, which utilizes Cloud Pub/Sub's push mechanism and leverages a dedicated service account with the Cloud Run Invoker role, aligns with the Google recommended practices for efficient, secure, and manageable message processing on Cloud Run.
