You create a new Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster and want to make sure that it always runs a supported and stable version of Kubernetes. What should you do?
	
	A. Enable the Node Auto-Repair feature for your GKE cluster.
	
	B. Enable the Node Auto-Upgrades feature for your GKE cluster. [✔️]
	
	C. Select the latest available cluster version for your GKE cluster.
	
	D. Select Container-Optimized OS (cos) as a node image for your GKE cluster. [Bard Suggested] [✔️]

-------

B. Enable the Node Auto-Upgrades feature for your GKE cluster.

	Recommended: Enabling Node Auto-Upgrades ensures that the nodes in your GKE cluster are automatically upgraded to the latest supported and stable version of Kubernetes. This helps in keeping your cluster up-to-date with security patches and new features.

A. Enable the Node Auto-Repair feature for your GKE cluster.

	Not directly related: Node Auto-Repair is focused on automatically repairing nodes that have been marked as unhealthy, rather than ensuring the Kubernetes version is up-to-date.

C. Select the latest available cluster version for your GKE cluster.

	Not as automatic: While manually selecting the latest cluster version is an option, it requires manual intervention and may not be as hands-off as using Node Auto-Upgrades.

D. Select "Container-Optimized OS (cos)" as a node image for your GKE cluster.

	Not directly related: The choice of the underlying OS image for nodes is not the primary mechanism for ensuring the Kubernetes version is stable and up-to-date.

Therefore, option B is the most appropriate for ensuring that your GKE cluster runs a supported and stable version of Kubernetes by automatically upgrading the nodes.

Bard:

	The most appropriate approach to ensure that a new Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster always runs a supported and stable version of Kubernetes is D. Select Container-Optimized OS (cos) as a node image for your GKE cluster.

		Container-Optimized OS (cos) is a lightweight, pre-configured Linux distribution optimized for running containerized applications on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). It comes with a guaranteed Kubernetes release cadence, ensuring that the cluster always runs a supported and stable version of Kubernetes.

	The other options are less suitable for this task:

		A. Enable the Node Auto-Repair feature for your GKE cluster: While Node Auto-Repair can help maintain the health of your cluster, it does not guarantee that the cluster will always run a supported and stable version of Kubernetes.

		B. Enable the Node Auto-Upgrades feature for your GKE cluster: Node Auto-Upgrades automates the upgrade process for GKE nodes, including kernel upgrades and container runtime upgrades. However, it does not guarantee that the upgraded version of Kubernetes will be supported and stable.

		C. Select the latest available cluster version for your GKE cluster: Selecting the latest available cluster version may not always ensure that the cluster is running a supported and stable version of Kubernetes. It is better to rely on a stable operating system like cos, which provides a guaranteed Kubernetes release cadence.
