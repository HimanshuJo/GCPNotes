You have an application that uses Cloud Spanner as a backend database. The application has a very predictable traffic pattern. You want to automatically scale up or down the number of Spanner nodes depending on traffic. What should you do?
	
	A. Create a cron job that runs on a scheduled basis to review stackdriver monitoring metrics, and then resize the Spanner instance accordingly.
	
	B. Create a Stackdriver alerting policy to send an alert to oncall SRE emails when Cloud Spanner CPU exceeds the threshold. SREs would scale resources up or down accordingly.
	
	C. Create a Stackdriver alerting policy to send an alert to Google Cloud Support email when Cloud Spanner CPU exceeds your threshold. Google support would scale resources up or down accordingly.
	
	D. Create a Stackdriver alerting policy to send an alert to webhook when Cloud Spanner CPU is over or under your threshold. Create a Cloud Function that listens to HTTP and resizes Spanner resources accordingly. [✔️]

-------

Option D (Cloud Monitoring alerting policy with a Cloud Function):

	Reasoning:

		This option involves creating a Cloud Monitoring alerting policy to send an alert to a webhook when Cloud Spanner CPU is over or under the specified threshold.
		
		A Cloud Function is then created to listen to the HTTP webhook and resize the Spanner resources accordingly.
	
	Steps:

		Create a Cloud Monitoring alerting policy based on CPU thresholds for Cloud Spanner.
		
		Configure the alerting policy to send alerts to a webhook.
		
		Create a Cloud Function that listens to the HTTP webhook.
		
		Implement logic in the Cloud Function to resize the Cloud Spanner resources based on the alert.
	
	Considerations:

		This approach allows for automated scaling based on specific metrics, such as CPU usage.
		
		The Cloud Function provides flexibility to execute custom logic for resizing resources.
	
	Benefits:

		Automation: The solution automates the scaling process based on predefined conditions.
		
		Flexibility: The Cloud Function can accommodate custom logic if needed.
	
	Drawbacks:

		Complexity: Implementing a Cloud Function introduces additional complexity compared to some other solutions.
		
		Maintenance: Regular monitoring and maintenance of the Cloud Function may be required.
		
		In summary, Option D is suitable for automated scaling based on Cloud Monitoring alerts. It provides flexibility and customization options, but it comes with the trade-off of increased complexity. The choice may depend on the organization's preference for automation and the level of customization required for the scaling process.

Other Options:

	Option A (Cron job for scheduled resizing):

		Reasoning:
		
			This option suggests creating a cron job that runs on a scheduled basis to review Cloud Monitoring metrics and resize the Spanner instance accordingly.
		
		Considerations:
		
			Creating a cron job adds an automated scheduling element, but it lacks the real-time responsiveness that an alerting policy can provide.
			
			This method may not be suitable for handling sudden spikes or drops in traffic since it relies on a scheduled execution.
		
		Benefits:
		
			Simplicity: The approach is straightforward and involves scheduled tasks.
			
			Predictability: Resource adjustments are made at predefined intervals.
		
	Option B (Alerting policy for SREs to manually scale):

		Reasoning:
			
			This option involves creating a Cloud Monitoring alerting policy to send alerts to on-call SRE emails when Cloud Spanner CPU exceeds the threshold. SREs would then manually scale resources.
		
		Considerations:
		
			Manual intervention is required, and scaling decisions depend on human response time.
			
			It may be suitable for scenarios where real-time automated scaling is not critical, and human decision-making is preferred.
		
		Benefits:
			
			Human Control: SREs have direct control over resource scaling decisions.
			
			Adjustability: Manual scaling allows for adjustments based on context and considerations.
		
	Option C (Alerting policy for Google Cloud Support to scale):

		Reasoning:
			
			This option involves creating a Cloud Monitoring alerting policy to send alerts to Google Cloud Support email when Cloud Spanner CPU exceeds the threshold. Google support would then manually scale resources.
		
		Considerations:
		
			Similar to Option B, this approach relies on manual intervention by Google Cloud Support.
			
			It might be suitable for organizations that rely on external support for infrastructure management.
		
		Benefits:
			
			External Expertise: Involves Google Cloud Support in the scaling process.
			
			Access to Support Resources: Utilizes support resources for making scaling decisions.
	
	In summary:

		Option A (Scheduled resizing): Suitable for predictable, periodic adjustments but may not be responsive to real-time changes.

		Option B (Alerting for manual scaling): Suitable when human intervention is acceptable, and real-time scaling is not critical.

		Option C (Alerting for Google Cloud Support to scale): Suitable for organizations relying on external support for infrastructure management.

Bard:

	The best approach to automatically scale up or down the number of Spanner nodes depending on traffic using a predictable pattern is to create a Stackdriver alerting policy to send an alert to webhook when Cloud Spanner CPU is over or under your threshold. Create a Cloud Function that listens to HTTP and resizes Spanner resources accordingly.

		This approach utilizes Stackdriver's alerting capabilities to trigger a webhook notification when CPU thresholds are met, and then employs a Cloud Function to programmatically resize the Spanner instance in response to traffic fluctuations.

	Option A, creating a cron job to manually review metrics and manually resize instances, is not a scalable or efficient solution for dynamic scaling.

	Option B, relying on on-call SREs to manually scale instances upon receiving alerts, introduces delays and potential human errors.

	Option C, involving Google Cloud Support in resource scaling, is not practical and may not provide the desired level of responsiveness.

	Therefore, the most appropriate approach is to utilize Stackdriver's alerting capabilities to trigger a webhook notification, which is then handled by a Cloud Function to automatically resize the Spanner instance in accordance with traffic trends.
