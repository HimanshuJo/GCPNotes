If you need to create a custom VPC with a single subnet, and the subnet's range should be as large as possible, you should choose a private IP address range that provides a large number of available addresses. Among the options provided:

B. 10.0.0.0/8
C. 172.16.0.0/12
D. 192.168.0.0/16

The largest address space is provided by option B. 10.0.0.0/8. This subnet range covers IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, offering a total of 16,777,216 (2^24) unique IPv4 addresses. Therefore, choosing option B would give you the largest possible subnet range.
