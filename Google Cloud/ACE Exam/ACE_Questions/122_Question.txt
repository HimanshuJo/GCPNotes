Your company is moving from an on-premises environment to Google Cloud. You have multiple development teams that use Cassandra environments as backend databases. They all need a development environment that is isolated from other Cassandra instances. You want to move to Google Cloud quickly and with minimal support effort. What should you do?
	
	1. Build an instruction guide to install Cassandra on Google Cloud. 2. Make the instruction guide accessible to your developers.
	
	1. Advise your developers to go to Cloud Marketplace. 2. Ask the developers to launch a Cassandra image for their development work. [✔️]

Bard:

	The best approach to provide isolated Cassandra development environments for multiple teams with minimal support effort is to build a Cassandra Compute Engine instance and take a snapshot of it. Upload the snapshot to Cloud Storage and make it accessible to your developers. Build instructions to create a Compute Engine instance from the snapshot so that developers can do it themselves.

	This approach offers several advantages:

		Ease of use: 

			Developers can simply download the snapshot and create a new Cassandra instance in a few clicks without having to manually install and configure Cassandra.

		Isolation: 

			Each developer gets their own isolated Cassandra instance, ensuring that their data and configurations are separate from other teams.

		Scalability: 

			Developers can easily scale their Cassandra instances up or down based on their needs.

		Minimal support: 

			Once the initial setup is complete, developers can handle the creation and management of their Cassandra instances themselves, minimizing the need for support from IT staff.

	Option A is not recommended because building and maintaining custom instruction guides can be time-consuming and error-prone.

	Option B is not recommended because relying on Cloud Marketplace images may not provide the level of customization and control needed for development environments.

	Option C is not recommended because creating and managing individual snapshots for each developer can be cumbersome and inefficient.
