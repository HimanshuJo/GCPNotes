An application generates daily reports in a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM). The VM is in the project corp-iot-insights. Your team operates only in the project corp-aggregate-reports and needs a copy of the daily exports in the bucket corp-aggregate-reports-storage. You want to configure access so that the daily reports from the VM are available in the bucket corp-aggregate-reports-storage and use as few steps as possible while following Google-recommended practices. What should you do?
	
	A. Move both projects under the same folder. [Suggested]
	
	B. Grant the VM Service Account the role Storage Object Creator on corp-aggregate-reports-storage. [✔️]
	
	C. Create a Shared VPC network between both projects. Grant the VM Service Account the role Storage Object Creator on corp-iot-insights.
	
	D. Make corp-aggregate-reports-storage public and create a folder with a pseudo-randomized suffix name. Share the folder with the IoT team.

To configure access so that the daily reports from the Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) in the project corp-iot-insights are available in the bucket corp-aggregate-reports-storage in the project corp-aggregate-reports while following Google-recommended practices, you should consider granting appropriate roles to the service account and managing access securely. Let's evaluate each option:

A. Move both projects under the same folder.

	Moving projects under the same folder is not a recommended approach for managing cross-project access to resources. Folders are more for organizational purposes, and moving projects into the same folder doesn't inherently grant access between them.

B. Grant the VM Service Account the role Storage Object Creator on corp-aggregate-reports-storage.

	This is a reasonable option. Granting the VM's service account the role of Storage Object Creator on the target bucket allows the VM to write objects (daily reports) to the specified bucket.

C. Create a Shared VPC network between both projects. Grant the VM Service Account the role Storage Object Creator on corp-iot-insights.

	Shared VPCs are primarily for sharing a network between projects, and it might be an unnecessary step for simply writing objects to a Cloud Storage bucket. Granting the VM's service account the necessary role directly on the bucket (Option B) is a more straightforward solution.

D. Make corp-aggregate-reports-storage public and create a folder with a pseudo-randomized suffix name. Share the folder with the IoT team.

	Making the storage bucket public is generally not recommended for secure data access. Additionally, sharing a folder with the IoT team may not be necessary, as access controls at the bucket level are typically sufficient.

Conclusion:
	
	Option B, "Grant the VM Service Account the role Storage Object Creator on corp-aggregate-reports-storage," is a suitable and straightforward approach. It provides the necessary permissions for the VM to write daily reports to the specified Cloud Storage bucket without introducing unnecessary complexity.

Bard:

	The correct answer is B. Grant the VM Service Account the role Storage Object Creator on corp-aggregate-reports-storage. This is the most secure and efficient way to grant the necessary permissions to the VM while adhering to Google's recommended practices.

	Option A, moving both projects under the same folder, would unnecessarily complicate the organization and not directly address the access issue.

	Option C, creating a Shared VPC network between both projects, would introduce additional complexity and potential security risks. It's not necessary to grant the entire Shared VPC network access to the bucket. Instead, it's more secure to grant specific permissions to the VM Service Account, which is directly associated with the VM.

	Option D, making corp-aggregate-reports-storage public and creating a folder to share with the IoT team, is a less secure approach as it exposes the bucket to unauthorized access. Additionally, creating a pseudo-randomized folder suffix doesn't provide effective security measures.

	Therefore, granting the VM Service Account the role Storage Object Creator on corp-aggregate-reports-storage is the most appropriate and secure solution to manage access to the daily reports from the VM. This approach minimizes the number of steps, adheres to Google's recommended practices, and provides granular control over permissions.
