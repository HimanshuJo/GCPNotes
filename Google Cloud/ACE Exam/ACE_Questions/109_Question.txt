Your organization has user identities in Active Directory. Your organization wants to use Active Directory as their source of truth for identities. Your organization wants to have full control over the Google accounts used by employees for all Google services, including your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) organization. What should you do?
	
	A. Use Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) to synchronize users into Cloud Identity. [✔️]
	
	B. Use the cloud Identity APIs and write a script to synchronize users to Cloud Identity.
	
	C. Export users from Active Directory as a CSV and import them to Cloud Identity via the Admin Console.
	
	D. Ask each employee to create a Google account using self signup. Require that each employee use their company email address and password.

A. Use Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) to synchronize users into Cloud Identity.

	Recommended: Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) is a tool that synchronizes user and group details from an Active Directory server to Cloud Identity or Google Workspace. It allows you to maintain control over user identities in Active Directory while ensuring synchronization with Google Cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

B. Use the Cloud Identity APIs and write a script to synchronize users to Cloud Identity.

	Possible but more complex: While using APIs is a valid option, Google provides a dedicated tool (GCDS) for this purpose, which is more user-friendly and tailored for directory synchronization. Writing a custom script might be more complex and error-prone.

C. Export users from Active Directory as a CSV and import them to Cloud Identity via the Admin Console.

	Not efficient for ongoing synchronization: This method is manual and not suitable for ongoing synchronization of user identities. GCDS provides automated and scheduled synchronization.

D. Ask each employee to create a Google account using self-signup. Require that each employee use their company email address and password.

	Not recommended: This approach lacks central control and doesn't ensure that user identities are synchronized with the Active Directory source of truth. It may lead to inconsistencies and security concerns.

In summary, option A, using Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS), is recommended as it provides a robust and automated solution for synchronizing user identities from Active Directory to Cloud Identity, ensuring that your organization maintains control over Google accounts used for all Google services, including GCP.

Bard:

	The correct answer is A. Use Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) to synchronize users into Cloud Identity.

		Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) is the recommended solution to synchronize user identities from Active Directory to Cloud Identity. GCDS is a fully managed service that can be used to automate the synchronization of user accounts, groups, and other directory objects. This allows your organization to keep its Active Directory as the source of truth for identities, while still providing full control over the Google accounts used by employees for all Google services.

	Option B is incorrect because writing a script to synchronize users to Cloud Identity manually would be a complex and time-consuming task. GCDS is a more efficient and reliable solution for this purpose.

	Option C is incorrect because exporting users from Active Directory as a CSV file and importing them to Cloud Identity via the Admin Console would be a one-time solution. GCDS is a continuous synchronization solution that can keep your Active Directory and Cloud Identity in sync at all times.

	Option D is incorrect because asking each employee to create a Google account using self signup would lead to a lack of control over the Google accounts used by employees. GCDS ensures that all Google accounts are managed centrally by your organization.

	Therefore, the best way to synchronize user identities from Active Directory to Cloud Identity while maintaining full control over Google accounts is to use Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS). GCDS is a fully managed service that can automate the synchronization of user accounts, groups, and other directory objects, keeping your Active Directory as the source of truth for identities and providing centralized control over Google accounts.
