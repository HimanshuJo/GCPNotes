You are using multiple configurations for gcloud. You want to review the configured Kubernetes Engine cluster of an inactive configuration using the fewest possible steps. What should you do?
	
	A. Use gcloud config configurations describe to review the output.
	
	B. Use gcloud config configurations activate and gcloud config list to review the output.
	
	C. Use kubectl config get-contexts to review the output.
	
	D. Use kubectl config use-context and kubectl config view to review the output. [✔️]

Bard:

	The correct answer is D. Use kubectl config use-context and kubectl config view to review the output.

		This approach is the most straightforward and efficient way to review the configured Kubernetes Engine cluster of an inactive configuration. By using kubectl config use-context to switch to the inactive configuration, you can then use kubectl config view to display the configured cluster information.

	The other options are not suitable for this situation:

		Option A, using gcloud config configurations describe, only provides information about the active configuration. To view the configuration of an inactive configuration, you need to activate it first.

		Option B, using gcloud config configurations activate and gcloud config list, involves two steps and is more complex than using kubectl config use-context directly.

		Option C, using kubectl config get-contexts, only lists the available contexts but doesn't provide detailed information about the configured clusters.

	Therefore, using kubectl config use-context to switch to the inactive configuration and then kubectl config view to display the configured cluster information is the most efficient and accurate way to review the configured Kubernetes Engine cluster of an inactive configuration.
