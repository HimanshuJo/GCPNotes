You are given a project with a single Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and a single subnetwork in the us-central1 region. There is a Compute Engine instance hosting an application in this subnetwork. You need to deploy a new instance in the same project in the europe-west1 region. This new instance needs access to the application. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. What should you do?
	
	A. 1. Create a subnetwork in the same VPC, in europe-west1. 2. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the first instance's private address as the endpoint. [✔️]

	C. 1. Create a subnetwork in the same VPC, in europe-west1. 2. Use Cloud VPN to connect the two subnetworks. 3. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the first instance's private address as the endpoint.
	
	D. 1. Create a VPC and a subnetwork in europe-west1. 2. Peer the 2 VPCs. 3. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the first instance's private address as the endpoint.

Bard:

	The most appropriate and Google-recommended approach for allowing the new instance in europe-west1 to access the application in us-central1 is B. 1. Create a VPC and a subnetwork in europe-west1. 2. Expose the application with an internal load balancer. 3. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the load balancer's address as the endpoint.

	This approach offers several advantages:

		Secure Communication: 

			By exposing the application with an internal load balancer, you can restrict its access to authorized instances within the VPC. This enhances security and prevents unauthorized connections.

		Scalability and Flexibility: 

			Using an internal load balancer allows you to scale the application horizontally by adding more instances behind the load balancer. It also provides flexibility in managing the application's traffic distribution.

		Simplified Deployment: 

			By deploying the new instance in a separate VPC and subnetwork, you avoid the complexities of peering or VPN connections, which can be more difficult to manage and troubleshoot.

	The other options have limitations:

		Option A: Creating a subnetwork in the same VPC but different region introduces unnecessary complexity and potential security risks.

		Option C: Using Cloud VPN to connect the two subnetworks adds additional overhead and introduces latency due to the VPN tunnel.

		Option D: Peering the two VPCs is a secure method but requires configuring and managing the peering connection. It may be more complex and less scalable than using an internal load balancer.

	Therefore, option B, which utilizes an internal load balancer to expose the application securely and deploys the new instance in a separate VPC for simplicity and scalability, aligns with the Google recommended practices for VPC interconnection and application accessibility.
