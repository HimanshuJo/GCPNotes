The core business of your company is to rent out construction equipment at large scale. All the equipment that is being rented out has been equipped with multiple sensors that send event information every few seconds. These signals can vary from engine status, distance traveled, fuel level, and more. Customers are billed based on the consumption monitored by these sensors. You expect high throughput - up to thousands of events per hour per device - and need to retrieve consistent data based on the time of the event. Storing and retrieving individual signals should be atomic. What should you do?
	
	Create a file in Cloud Storage per device and append new data to that file.
	
	Create a file in Cloud Filestore per device and append new data to that file.
	
	Ingest the data into Datastore. Store data in an entity group based on the device.
	
	Ingest the data into Cloud Bigtable. Create a row key based on the event timestamp. [✔️]

	The correct answer is **D. Ingest the data into Cloud Bigtable. Create a row key based on the event timestamp. **

		Cloud Bigtable is a highly scalable, durable, and low-latency NoSQL database that is well-suited for handling high-throughput applications with stringent data consistency requirements. Storing and retrieving individual signals as separate rows in Cloud Bigtable with a row key based on the event timestamp ensures atomicity and consistency. This means that each event is recorded and retrieved as an individual unit, guaranteeing that no data is lost or corrupted.

		The high throughput of up to thousands of events per hour per device necessitates a database that can handle massive amounts of data efficiently. Cloud Bigtable's distributed architecture and high-performance data storage capabilities make it ideal for handling this level of data ingress and retrieval.

	Options A and B, using Cloud Storage or Cloud Filestore, are not suitable for this scenario due to their limited scalability and performance characteristics. Storing and retrieving event data in individual files would lead to performance bottlenecks and potentially data loss at high throughputs.

	Option C, using Datastore, while providing ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees, is not as well-suited for high-throughput scenarios as Cloud Bigtable. Additionally, storing device-specific event data in entity groups within Datastore might not offer the granularity required for efficient data retrieval based on event timestamps.

	Therefore, ingesting the data into Cloud Bigtable with a row key based on the event timestamp is the most appropriate solution for handling the high throughput of sensor event data from construction equipment and ensuring atomicity and consistency for billing purposes.
