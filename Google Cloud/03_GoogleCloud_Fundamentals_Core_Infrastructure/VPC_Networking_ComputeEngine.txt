Preemptible VMs

Very similar to an ordinary VM. It only has one differeence â€” it has permission to terminate if its resources are needed elsewhere. You can save a lot of money with preemptible VMs, you just should make sure that your job is able to be stopped and restarted.

An SLA (service-level agreement)

	is a contract between clients and a service provider that outlines the services the provider will offer and the service standards it is required to uphold.

	SLAs are very necessary for service providers to manage customer expectations and to specify the severity levels and conditions of the agreement.
