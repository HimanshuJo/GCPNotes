	-------

	Considerations:
		
		Data Model:

			Cloud Bigtable is a column-family store, suitable for wide-column data.
			
			Cloud Firestore and Cloud Datastore are document databases, suitable for hierarchical and structured data.
			
			Cloud Spanner is a globally distributed, strongly consistent relational database.
		
		Scalability:

			Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Datastore scale horizontally based on demand.
			
			Cloud Spanner scales globally and provides strong consistency.
		
		Use Case:

			Cloud Bigtable is optimized for high-throughput, low-latency access to large datasets.
			
			Cloud Firestore and Cloud Datastore are suitable for web and mobile applications with real-time data needs.
			
			Cloud Spanner is designed for globally distributed applications with strong consistency requirements.
		
		Consistency Model:

			Cloud Bigtable provides eventual consistency.
			
			Cloud Firestore and Cloud Datastore provide eventual consistency but also support strong consistency for specific queries.
			
			Cloud Spanner provides strong consistency across globally distributed data.
		
		Integration:

			Consider integration with other GCP services based on your application requirements.
		
		In summary, the choice between these GCP database services depends on your specific use case, data model preferences, scalability requirements, and consistency needs. Each service is optimized for different scenarios, so understanding your application's characteristics will guide the selection process.
