There are three types of roles in Cloud IAM:

	basic roles

	predefined roles

	and custom roles.

-------

Basic roles are the original roles that were available in the Cloud console, but they are broad

	You apply them to a Google Cloud project, and they affect all resources in that project

	In other words, IAM basic roles offer fixed, coarse-grained levels of access

	The basic roles are the

		owner

			The owner has full administrative access

			That is the owner role includes the permissions of the editor role

		editor

			The editor role has modify and delete access

			This allows the developer to deploy applications and modify or configure its resources

			The editor role includes the permissions of the viewer role

		viewer roles

			The view role has read only access

-------

Compute Engine has several predefined IAM roles

	The Compute Admin role provides full control of all Compute Engine resources

-------

The Network Admin role Contains permissions to create, modify and delete network resources, except for firewall rules and SSL certificates

	In other words, the network admin role allows read only access to firewall rules SSL certificates, and instances to view their ephemeral IP addresses

-------

The storage admin role contains permissions to create, modify, and delete disks, images, and snapshots
