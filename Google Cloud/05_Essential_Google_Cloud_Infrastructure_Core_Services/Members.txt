There are five different types of members: 

	Google Accounts

	Service Accounts

	Google Groups

	Google Workspace domains, and 

	Cloud Identity domains

-------

A service account is an account that belongs to your application instead of to an individual end user

	When you run code that is hosted on Google Cloud, you specify the account that the code should run as

	You can create as many service accounts as needed to represent the different logical components of your application

-------

A Google group is a named collection of Google accounts and service accounts

	Every group has a unique email address that is associated with the group

	Google groups are a convenient way to apply an access policy to a collection of users

-------

A Workspace domain represents a virtual group of all the Google accounts that have been created in an organization's Workspace account

	Workspace domains represent your organization's internet domain name, such as example.com, and when you add a user to your Workspace domain, a new Google account is created for the user inside this virtual group, such as username@example.com

-------

Cloud Identity lets you manage users and groups using the Google Admin Console, but you do not pay for or receive Workspace’s collaboration products such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Calendar

-------

Now it’s important to note that you cannot use IAM to create or manage your users or groups

	Instead, you can use Cloud Identity or Workspace to create and manage users

-------

Policy:

	A policy consists of a list of bindings

	A binding binds a list of members to a role, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups, Google domains, and service accounts

	A policy is a collection of access statements attached to a resource

	Each policy contains a set of roles and role members, with resources inheriting policies from their parent

-------

Policy insights:

	are ML-based findings about permission usage in your project, folder, or organization

-------

Role:

	A role is a named list of permissions defined by IAM

-------

The IAM policy hierarchy always follows the same path as the Google Cloud resource hierarchy, which means that if you change the resource hierarchy, the policy hierarchy also changes

-------

	IAM Conditions 

		allow you to define and enforce conditional, attribute-based access control for Google Cloud resources

		you can choose to grant resource access to identities (members) only if configured conditions are met
