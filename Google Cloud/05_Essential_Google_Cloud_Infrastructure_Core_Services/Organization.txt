The organization resource is the root node in the GCP resource hierarchy

	This node has many roles, like the organization admin

-------

In the context of GCP organization setup, the G Suite or Cloud Identity super administrator responsibilities are: 

	assign the organization admin role to some users, be a point of contact in case of recovery issues

	control the lifecycle of the G Suite or Cloud Identity account and organization resource

-------

The responsibilities of the organization admin role are: 

	define IAM policies

	determine the structure of the resource hierarchy, delegate responsibility over critical components such as networking, billing, and resource hierarchy, through IAM roles

	following the principle of least privilege, this role does not include the permission to perform other actions, such as creating folders

	to get these permissions, an organization admin must assign additional roles to their account

-------

Folders:

	They can be viewed as sub organizations within the organization

	Folders provide an additional grouping mechanism and isolation boundary between projects

	Folders can be used to model different legal entities, departments, and teams within a company

	-------

	For example, a first-level of folders can be used to represent the main departments in your organization, like departments x and y

	Because folders, can contain projects in other folders, each folder could then include other sub-folders to represent different teams, like teams A and B

		Each team folder could contain additional sub-folders, to represent different applications, like products 1 and 2

-------

The folder node has multiple roles that mimic the organizational roles, but are applied to resources within a folder

	There is an admin role that provides full control over folders

	A creator role, to browse the hierarchy and create folders

	A viewer role, to view folders and projects below a resource

-------

Similarly for projects, there is:

	A creator role that allows a user to create new projects, making that user automatically the owner

	There is also a project deleter role that grants deletion privileges for projects
